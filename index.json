However, the notion of “understanding” (and the goal of artificial intelligent machines) goes beyond factual recall of the recognized components and includes reasoning and thinking beyond what can be seen (or perceived). Understanding is often evaluated by asking questions of increasing difficulty. Thus, the expected functionalities of an intelligent Image Understanding system can be expressed in terms of the functionalities that are required to answer questions about an image. Answering questions about images require primarily three components: Image Understanding, question (natural language) understanding, and reasoning based on knowledge. Any question, asking beyond what can be directly seen, requires modeling of commonsense (or background/ontological/factual) knowledge and reasoning.\nKnowledge and reasoning have seen scarce use in image understanding applications. In this thesis, we demonstrate the utilities of incorporating background knowledge and using explicit reasoning in image understanding applications. We first present a comprehensive survey of the previous work that utilized background knowledge and reasoning in understanding images. This survey outlines the limited use of commonsense knowledge in high-level applications. We then present a set of vision and reasoning-based methods to solve several applications and show that these approaches benefit in terms of accuracy and interpretability from the explicit use of knowledge and reasoning. We propose novel knowledge representations of image, knowledge acquisition methods, and a new implementation of an efficient probabilistic logical reasoning engine that can utilize publicly available commonsense knowledge to solve applications such as visual question answering, image puzzles. Additionally, we identify the need for new datasets that explicitly require external commonsense knowledge to solve. We propose the new task of Image Riddles, which requires a combination of vision, and reasoning based on ontological knowledge; and we collect a sufficiently large dataset to serve as an ideal testbed for vision and reasoning research. Lastly, we propose end-to-end deep architectures that can combine vision, knowledge and reasoning modules together and achieve large performance boosts over state-of-the-art methods\n","date":1546992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546992000,"objectID":"0f40cf545adf79432be77d9037b7794b","permalink":"https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/thesis/","publishdate":"2019-01-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis/","section":"publication","summary":"Image Understanding is a long-established discipline in computer vision, which encompasses a body of advanced image processing techniques, that are used to locate (“where”), characterize and recognize (“what”) objects, regions, and their attributes in the image.

My present goal is to evaluate, enhance and explain the reasoning capabilities of such systems (or language models).\n Natural Language Inference  Large pre-trained language models show high performance in popular NLP benchmarks (GLUE, SuperGLUE), while failing poorly in datasets with targeted linguistic and logical phenomena. We consolidate the interesting reasoning phenomena in Taxonomy of reasoning w.r.t the NLI task. Our first work along this line published in CoNLL 2020 showed that these models (BERT, RoBERTa) may not know how to perform certain types of reasoning such as causal, numeric, spatial, temporal; but they can identify the type of reasoning required for a new example.\nWe did a follow-up, adapting the CheckList methodology, where we create a large CheckList-NLI dataset to individually yet collectively test different reasoning capabilities, including pragmatic ones. Through our test-suite, we show that such a post-hoc evaluation provides a more comprehensive overview of the behavioral nature of the language models. A thorough human study with Linguistic Olympiad participants shows that behavioral summary leads to better explanation and RoBERTa\u0026rsquo;s behavior is more predictable than BERT.\nPreviously I have been interested in mapping natural language to formal language representation and reasoning with it. My proposed solutions towards Question-Answering and Winograd Schema Challenge during my Ph.D have been motivated by the central idea of semantic parsing, followed by logical (or probabilistic logical) reasoning.\n Semantic Parsing (K-Parser)  We (led by co-authors Arpit Sharma and Nguyen Vo) have explored mapping of natural language to formal representation, that enbales logical reasoning. Through several papers (K-Parser IJCAI-15, K-Parser NAACL 15), we showed how such semantic parsing enables us to find event mentions, and (even patially but interpretably) solved Winograd Schema challenge problems.\nReferences     Ishan Tarunesh, Somak Aditya, Monojit Choudhury.

Cognitive Sciences and Active Vision literature points to an explicit iterative interaction among perception, reasoning, and memeory (knowledge) modules (DeepIU ACS 2015).\n Captioning  In our earliest attempt (CVIU 2017 ), we used a combination of image classification, reasoning with commonsense knowledge (extracted from training captions) to propose a Scene Description Graph as an intermediate representation for a natural image. We showed the efficacy of this representation through image captioning, image retrieval tasks (and QA case studies.)\n Visual QA, Image Puzzles and Visual Reasoning  We have proposed instantiations of this abstract architecture to solve image puzzles, VQA and visual reasoning tasks such as CLEVR. In our AAAI 2018 VQA, and UAI 2018 Puzzles work, we have proposed an explicit probabilistic soft logic layer on top of a neural architecture that helps integrate commonsense knowledge and induces post-hoc interpretability.\nLater on, for an end-to-end (differentiable) integration of spatial knowledge, we explore a combination of knowledge distillation, probabilistic logic, and relational network in our WACV 2019 CLEVR.\nReferences     Somak Aditya, Yezhou Yang, Chitta Baral.

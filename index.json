Lastly, to build deployable AI systems, interpretability and human-AI (extrinsic) trust is essential.

However, the notion of “understanding” (and the goal of artificial intelligent machines) goes beyond factual recall of the recognized components and includes reasoning and thinking beyond what can be seen (or perceived). Understanding is often evaluated by asking questions of increasing difficulty. Thus, the expected functionalities of an intelligent Image Understanding system can be expressed in terms of the functionalities that are required to answer questions about an image. Answering questions about images require primarily three components: Image Understanding, question (natural language) understanding, and reasoning based on knowledge. Any question, asking beyond what can be directly seen, requires modeling of commonsense (or background/ontological/factual) knowledge and reasoning.\nKnowledge and reasoning have seen scarce use in image understanding applications. In this thesis, we demonstrate the utilities of incorporating background knowledge and using explicit reasoning in image understanding applications. We first present a comprehensive survey of the previous work that utilized background knowledge and reasoning in understanding images. This survey outlines the limited use of commonsense knowledge in high-level applications. We then present a set of vision and reasoning-based methods to solve several applications and show that these approaches benefit in terms of accuracy and interpretability from the explicit use of knowledge and reasoning. We propose novel knowledge representations of image, knowledge acquisition methods, and a new implementation of an efficient probabilistic logical reasoning engine that can utilize publicly available commonsense knowledge to solve applications such as visual question answering, image puzzles. Additionally, we identify the need for new datasets that explicitly require external commonsense knowledge to solve. We propose the new task of Image Riddles, which requires a combination of vision, and reasoning based on ontological knowledge; and we collect a sufficiently large dataset to serve as an ideal testbed for vision and reasoning research.

Specifically, for a question posed against an image, we use a probabilistic logical language to encode the spatial knowledge and the spatial understanding about the question in the form of a mask that is directly provided to the teacher network. The student network learns from the ground-truth information as well as the teacher’s prediction via distillation. We also demonstrate the impact of predicting such a mask inside the teacher’s network using attention.

In this paper, we develop an architecture for understanding images, through which a system can recognize the content and the underlying concepts of an image and, reason and answer questions about both using a visual module, a reasoning module, and a commonsense knowledge base. In this architecture, visual data combines with background knowledge and; iterates through visual and reasoning modules to answer questions about an image or to generate a textual description of an image.","tags":null,"title":"DeepIU: An Architecture for Image Understanding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somak Aditya","Yezhou Yang","Chitta Baral","Cornelia Fermuller","Yiannis Aloimonos"],"categories":null,"content":"In this paper we propose the construction of linguistic descriptions of images.

Amazon Mechanical Turk(AMT)-based evaluations on Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS-COCO datasets show that in most cases, sentences auto-constructed from SDGs obtained by our method give a more relevant and thorough description of an image than a recent state-of-the-art image caption based approach.

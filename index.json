Parallel to exploring neuro(symbolic) methods in the context of NLI, I am also exploring multi-hop reasoning capabilities of neural methods in symbolic domains with Dr. Navin Goyal.\nOverall, my central goal in research has been devloping models that learns from data, yet enriched by knowledge and capable of reasoning with such knowledge. Developing such models require three central considerations: knowledge acquisition, representation and reasoning. At MSRI and during my PhD, a fundamental observation was that, often an equal measure of concentration is required for each application.\nDuring my doctoral studies, my efforts revolved around Image Understanding under the supervision of Prof. Chitta Baral (Past President of KR.inc, 2016-2018). I was also co-advised by Dr. Yezhou Yang (Assistant Professor, ASU). Through a combination of Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation and Probabilistic Logical Reasoning; I demonstrated the benefits of using reasoning and knowledge in Visual Question-Answering (IJCAI, AAAI), Captioning (CVIU), image puzzle solving (UAI) and visual reasoning (WACV). I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from CIDSE, Arizona State University on June 27, 2018.\nI completed my Masters (ME) in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore in 2011 with a concentration in Machine Learning under the supervision of Prof. M Narasimha Murty (Dean, Faculty of Engineering, IISc). I have done my Bachelors in CS from Jadavpur University in 2009.

We propose a framework that combines recent advances in knowledge distillation (teacherstudent framework), relational reasoning and probabilistic logical languages to incorporate such knowledge in existing neural networks for the surrogate task of fact-based Visual Question Answering. Specifically, for a question posed against an image, we use a probabilistic logical language to encode the spatial knowledge and the spatial understanding about the question in the form of a mask that is directly provided to the teacher network. The student network learns from the ground-truth information as well as the teacher’s prediction via distillation.

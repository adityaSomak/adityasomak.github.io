Major Update: I have joined IIT Kharagpur CSE as an Assistant Professor on November 2021. I am looking for motivated Ph.D, MTech, and BTech students. !!!  -- I am an Assistant Professor (Grade I) at IIT Kharagpur Department of CSE. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research India advised by Dr. Monojit Choudhury. Prior to joining MSR India, I spent 1.5 years in Adobe Research as a full-time Researcher. I completed by Ph.D from CIDSE, Arizona State University in June 2018, under the supervision of Prof. Chitta Baral and Prof. Yezhou Yang.\nDeployable AI systems should be able to reason with knowledge that is commonplace to humans. Thus, my research aims to enhance, evaluate, and explain different types of complex reasoning abilities of AI systems. At MSRI, I explored evaluation and enhancement of reasoning capabilities of Transformers-based language models. Apart from end-to-end reasoning, I am paralley exploring multi-hop reasoning capabilities of neural methods in both symbolic and natural language domains. During my Ph.D, I have explored enhancement of reasoning capabilities of image understanding systems. Through a combination of Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation, and Probabilistic Logical Reasoning, I demonstrated the benefits of using reasoning and knowledge in Visual Question-Answering, Captioning, image puzzle solving and visual reasoning.\n","date":1708387200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1708387200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://adityasomak.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am looking for motivated full-time Ph.D students who are interested in pursuing their thesis in the exciting juncture of classical and statistical AI (often dubbed as neuro-symbolic methods).  -- Latest News   I am looking for motivated full-time Ph.D students who are interested in pursuing their thesis in the exciting juncture of classical and statistical AI (often dubbed as neuro-symbolic methods).     !!!

Such methods, however, fail to leverage the domain-specific nuances relevant to the task at hand. To avoid such drawbacks, domain counterfactual generation aims to transform a text from the source domain to a given target domain. However, due to the limited availability of data, such frequency-based methods often miss and lead to some valid and spurious domain-token associations. Hence, we employ a three-step domain obfuscation approach that involves frequency and attention norm-based masking, to mask domain-specific cues, and unmasking to regain the domain generic context. Our experiments empirically show that the counterfactual samples sourced from our masked text lead to improved domain transfer on 10 out of 12 domain sentiment classification settings, with an average of 2% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). Further our model outperforms the state-of-the-art by achieving 1.4% average accuracy improvement in the adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) setting. Moreover, our model also shows its domain adaptation efficacy on a large multi-domain intent classification dataset where it attains state-of-the-art results.\n","date":1683072000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683072000,"objectID":"d495766fb65d2a9c22a4678c728f35f1","permalink":"https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/counterfactualda/","publishdate":"2023-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/counterfactualda/","section":"publication","summary":"Domain shift is a big challenge in NLP, thus, many approaches resort to learning domain-invariant features to mitigate the inference phase domain shift.

While LLMs showcase striking results on existing math word problems, the true depth of their competencies and robustness, in mathematical reasoning tasks, remains an open question. In response, we develop (i) an ontology of perturbations of maths questions, (ii) a semi-automatic method of perturbation, and (iii) a dataset of perturbed maths questions to probe the limits of LLM capabilities in mathematical-reasoning tasks. Through careful perturbations of a simple dataset (GSM8k), we create a variant named MORE. We conducted comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs on More. The results show a significant performance drop across all the models against the perturbed questions. This strongly suggests that current LLMs lack robust mathematical skills and a deep understanding of reasoning. The work is currently published as an ArXiv Preprint.

Understanding is often evaluated by asking questions of increasing difficulty. Thus, the expected functionalities of an intelligent Image Understanding system can be expressed in terms of the functionalities that are required to answer questions about an image. Answering questions about images require primarily three components: Image Understanding, question (natural language) understanding, and reasoning based on knowledge. Any question, asking beyond what can be directly seen, requires modeling of commonsense (or background/ontological/factual) knowledge and reasoning.\nKnowledge and reasoning have seen scarce use in image understanding applications. In this thesis, we demonstrate the utilities of incorporating background knowledge and using explicit reasoning in image understanding applications. We first present a comprehensive survey of the previous work that utilized background knowledge and reasoning in understanding images. This survey outlines the limited use of commonsense knowledge in high-level applications. We then present a set of vision and reasoning-based methods to solve several applications and show that these approaches benefit in terms of accuracy and interpretability from the explicit use of knowledge and reasoning. We propose novel knowledge representations of image, knowledge acquisition methods, and a new implementation of an efficient probabilistic logical reasoning engine that can utilize publicly available commonsense knowledge to solve applications such as visual question answering, image puzzles. Additionally, we identify the need for new datasets that explicitly require external commonsense knowledge to solve. We propose the new task of Image Riddles, which requires a combination of vision, and reasoning based on ontological knowledge; and we collect a sufficiently large dataset to serve as an ideal testbed for vision and reasoning research.

We consolidate the interesting reasoning phenomena in Taxonomy of reasoning w.r.t the NLI task. Our first work along this line published in CoNLL 2020 showed that these models (BERT, RoBERTa) may not know how to perform certain types of reasoning such as causal, numeric, spatial, temporal; but they can identify the type of reasoning required for a new example.\nWe did a follow-up, adapting the CheckList methodology, where we create a large CheckList-NLI dataset to individually yet collectively test different reasoning capabilities, including pragmatic ones. Through our test-suite, we show that such a post-hoc evaluation provides a more comprehensive overview of the behavioral nature of the language models. A thorough human study with Linguistic Olympiad participants shows that behavioral summary leads to better explanation and RoBERTa\u0026rsquo;s behavior is more predictable than BERT. Currently, we are also exploring augmenting NLI datasets with verifiable proofs.\nSummary and Extensions:   TaxiNLI: Taxonomic Fragmentation of the NLI Task, CoNLL 2020   TaxiXNLI: Multi-lingual Extension of TaxiNLI, EMNLP 2021 MRL Workshop   LoNLI: Testing Diverse Reasoning of NLI Systems, LREV 2023, In Print, !!NEW!! \n\n  Enhancing NLI: Multi-hop, Causality and Counterfactuals \u0026 Reasoning in LLMs  As observed through TaxiNLI family of work, language models struggle with many important reasoning types.

We show that our approach works well with respect to a subset of Winograd schemas.\n","date":1437782400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437782400,"objectID":"bb34ce25543fd87f781141f65b493605","permalink":"https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/kparser/","publishdate":"2015-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kparser/","section":"publication","summary":"Concerned about the Turing test’s ability to correctly evaluate if a system exhibits human-like intelligence, the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) has been proposed as an alternative. A Winograd Schema consists of a sentence and a question. The answers to the questions are intuitive for humans but are designed to be difficult for machines, as they require various forms of commonsense knowledge about the sentence. In this paper we demonstrate our progress towards addressing the WSC.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Addressing the Winograd Schema Challenge-Building and Using a Semantic Parser and a Knowledge Hunting Module.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Somak Aditya","Yezhou Yang","Chitta Baral","Cornelia Fermuller","Yiannis Aloimonos"],"categories":null,"content":"In this paper we explore the use of visual commonsense knowledge and other kinds of knowledge (such as domain knowledge, background knowledge, linguistic knowledge) for scene understanding.

      <title>Integrating Knowledge and Reasoning in Image Understanding</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning based data-driven approaches have been successfully applied in various image under-
standing applications ranging from object recognition, semantic segmentation to visual question an-
swering.  However, the lack of knowledge integration as well as higher-level reasoning capabilities
with  the  methods  still  pose  a  hindrance. In  this work, we present a brief survey of a few represen-
tative  reasoning  mechanisms,  knowledge  integration methods and their corresponding image under-
standing applications developed by various groups of researchers, approaching the problem from a va-
riety of angles.  Furthermore, we discuss upon key efforts on integrating external knowledge with neu-
ral networks. Taking cues from these efforts, we conclude by discussing potential pathways to im-
prove reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Distillation to aid Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/spatialkd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For tasks involving language and vision, the current state-of-the-art methods do not leverage any additional information
that might be present to gather privileged knowledge. Instead, such an ability is expected to be learnt during the training
phase. One such task is Visual Question Answering, where large diagnostic datasets have been proposed to
test a system’s capability of reasoning and answering questions about images. In
this work, we take a step towards integrating this additional privileged information in the form of spatial knowledge to
aid in visual reasoning. We propose a framework that combines recent advances in knowledge distillation (teacherstudent
framework), relational reasoning and probabilistic logical languages to incorporate such knowledge in existing
neural networks for the surrogate task of fact-based Visual Question Answering. Specifically, for a question posed
against an image, we use a probabilistic logical language to encode the spatial knowledge and the spatial understanding
about the question in the form of a mask that is directly provided to the teacher network. The student network learns
from the ground-truth information as well as the teacher’s prediction via distillation. We also demonstrate the impact
of predicting such a mask inside the teacher’s network using attention. Empirically, we show that both the methods
improve the test accuracy over a state-of-the-art approach on a publicly available dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explicit Reasoning over End-to-End Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/pslvqa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many vision and language tasks require commonsense reasoning beyond data-driven image and natural language pro-
cessing. Here we adopt Visual Question Answering (VQA) as an example task, where a system is expected to answer a
question in natural language about an image. Current state-of-the-art systems attempted to solve the task using deep neural
architectures and achieved promising performance. However, the resulting systems are generally opaque and they struggle
in understanding questions for which extra knowledge is required. In this paper, we present an explicit reasoning layer on
top of a set of penultimate neural network based systems. The reasoning layer enables reasoning and answering questions
where additional knowledge is required, and at the same time provides an interpretable interface to the end users. Specif-
ically, the reasoning layer adopts a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based engine to reason over a basket of inputs: visual
relations, semantic parse of the question, and background ontological knowledge from word2vec and ConceptNet.
Experimental analysis of the answers and the key evidential predicates generated on the VQA dataset validate our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visual common-sense for scene understanding using perception, semantic parsing and reasoning.</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/common-sense/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we explore the use of visual commonsense
knowledge and other kinds of knowledge (such as
domain knowledge, background knowledge, linguistic
knowledge) for scene understanding. In particular, we
combine visual processing with techniques from natural
language understanding (especially semantic parsing),
common-sense reasoning and knowledge representation
and reasoning to improve visual perception to reason
about finer aspects of activities&lt;/p&gt;

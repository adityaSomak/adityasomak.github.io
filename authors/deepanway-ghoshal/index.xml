      <title>Generating Intermediate Steps for NLI with Next-Step Supervision</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Natural Language Inference (NLI) task often requires reasoning over multiple steps to reach the conclusion. While the necessity of generating such intermediate steps (instead of a summary explanation) has gained popular support, it is unclear how to generate such steps without complete end-to-end supervision and how such generated steps can be further utilized. In this work, we train a sequence-to-sequence model to generate only the next step given an NLI premise and hypothesis pair (and previous steps); then enhance it with external knowledge and symbolic search to generate intermediate steps with only next-step supervision. We show the correctness of such generated steps through automated and human verification. Furthermore, we show that such generated steps can help improve end-to-end NLI task performance using simple data augmentation strategies, across multiple public NLI datasets.&lt;/p&gt;

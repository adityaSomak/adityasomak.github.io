      <title>Towards LogiGLUE: A Brief Survey and A Benchmark for Analyzing Logical Reasoning Capabilities of Language Models</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Logical reasoning is fundamental for humans yet presents a substantial challenge in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. Initially, researchers used Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) systems that did not scale and required non-trivial manual effort. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated the ability to overcome various limitations of formal Knowledge Representation (KR) systems. Consequently, there’s a growing interest in using LLMs for logical reasoning via natural language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work strives to understand the proficiency of LLMs in logical reasoning by offering a brief review of the latest progress in this area; with a focus on the logical reasoning datasets, tasks, and the methods adopted to utilize LLMs for reasoning. To offer a thorough analysis, we’ve compiled a benchmark titled LogiGLUE. This includes 24 varied datasets encompassing deductive, abductive, and inductive reasoning. We have standardized these datasets into Seq2Seq tasks to facilitate straightforward training and evaluation for future research. Utilizing LogiGLUE as a foundation, we have trained an instruction fine-tuned language model, resulting in LogiT5. We study single-task training, multi-task training, and a &amp;ldquo;chain-of-thought&amp;rdquo; knowledge distillation finetuning technique to assess the model’s performance across the different logical reasoning categories. By this comprehensive process, we aim to shed light on the capabilities and potential pathways for enhancing logical reasoning proficiency in LLMs, paving the way for more advanced and nuanced developments in this
critical field.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Integrating Knowledge and Reasoning in Image Understanding</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/integratingsurvey/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning based data-driven approaches have been successfully applied in various image under-
standing applications ranging from object recognition, semantic segmentation to visual question an-
swering.  However, the lack of knowledge integration as well as higher-level reasoning capabilities
with  the  methods  still  pose  a  hindrance. In  this work, we present a brief survey of a few represen-
tative  reasoning  mechanisms,  knowledge  integration methods and their corresponding image under-
standing applications developed by various groups of researchers, approaching the problem from a va-
riety of angles.  Furthermore, we discuss upon key efforts on integrating external knowledge with neu-
ral networks. Taking cues from these efforts, we conclude by discussing potential pathways to im-
prove reasoning capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial Knowledge Distillation to aid Visual Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/spatialkd/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For tasks involving language and vision, the current state-of-the-art methods do not leverage any additional information
that might be present to gather privileged knowledge. Instead, such an ability is expected to be learnt during the training
phase. One such task is Visual Question Answering, where large diagnostic datasets have been proposed to
test a system’s capability of reasoning and answering questions about images. In
this work, we take a step towards integrating this additional privileged information in the form of spatial knowledge to
aid in visual reasoning. We propose a framework that combines recent advances in knowledge distillation (teacherstudent
framework), relational reasoning and probabilistic logical languages to incorporate such knowledge in existing
neural networks for the surrogate task of fact-based Visual Question Answering. Specifically, for a question posed
against an image, we use a probabilistic logical language to encode the spatial knowledge and the spatial understanding
about the question in the form of a mask that is directly provided to the teacher network. The student network learns
from the ground-truth information as well as the teacher’s prediction via distillation. We also demonstrate the impact
of predicting such a mask inside the teacher’s network using attention. Empirically, we show that both the methods
improve the test accuracy over a state-of-the-art approach on a publicly available dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Explicit Reasoning over End-to-End Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/pslvqa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many vision and language tasks require commonsense reasoning beyond data-driven image and natural language pro-
cessing. Here we adopt Visual Question Answering (VQA) as an example task, where a system is expected to answer a
question in natural language about an image. Current state-of-the-art systems attempted to solve the task using deep neural
architectures and achieved promising performance. However, the resulting systems are generally opaque and they struggle
in understanding questions for which extra knowledge is required. In this paper, we present an explicit reasoning layer on
top of a set of penultimate neural network based systems. The reasoning layer enables reasoning and answering questions
where additional knowledge is required, and at the same time provides an interpretable interface to the end users. Specif-
ically, the reasoning layer adopts a Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based engine to reason over a basket of inputs: visual
relations, semantic parse of the question, and background ontological knowledge from word2vec and ConceptNet.
Experimental analysis of the answers and the key evidential predicates generated on the VQA dataset validate our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recognizing social constructs from textual conversation</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/social/</link>

      <guid>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/social/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present our work on recognizing high level social constructs such as Leadership and Status from textual conversation using an approach that makes use of the background knowledge about social hierarchy and integrates statistical methods and symbolic logic based methods. We use a stratified approach in which we first detect lower level language constructs such as politeness, command and agreement that help us to infer intermediate constructs such as deference, closeness and authority that are observed between the parties engaged in conversation. These intermediate constructs in turn are used to determine the social constructs Leadership and Status. We have implemented this system successfully in both English and Korean languages and achieved considerable accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Towards Addressing the Winograd Schema Challenge-Building and Using a Semantic Parser and a Knowledge Hunting Module.</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/kparser/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the Turing test’s ability to correctly
evaluate if a system exhibits human-like intelligence,
the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC)
has been proposed as an alternative. A Winograd
Schema consists of a sentence and a question. The
answers to the questions are intuitive for humans
but are designed to be difficult for machines, as
they require various forms of commonsense knowledge
about the sentence. In this paper we demonstrate
our progress towards addressing the WSC.
We present an approach that identifies the knowledge
needed to answer a challenge question, hunts
down that knowledge from text repositories, and
then reasons with them to come up with the answer.
In the process we develop a semantic parser
(&lt;a href=&#34;www.kparser.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;www.kparser.org&lt;/a&gt;). We show that our approach
works well with respect to a subset of Winograd
schemas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Identifying various kinds of event mentions in k-parser output</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/identifying/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/identifying/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we show how our semantic parser (Knowledge Parser or K-Parser) identifies various kinds of event mentions in the input text. The types include recursive (complex) and non recursive event mentions. K-Parser outputs each event mention in form of an acyclic graph with root nodes as the verbs that drive those events. The children nodes of the verbs represent the entities participating in the events, and their conceptual classes. The on-line demo of the system is available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kparser.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;http://kparser.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visual common-sense for scene understanding using perception, semantic parsing and reasoning.</title>
      <link>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/common-sense/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://adityasomak.github.io/publication/common-sense/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we explore the use of visual commonsense
knowledge and other kinds of knowledge (such as
domain knowledge, background knowledge, linguistic
knowledge) for scene understanding. In particular, we
combine visual processing with techniques from natural
language understanding (especially semantic parsing),
common-sense reasoning and knowledge representation
and reasoning to improve visual perception to reason
about finer aspects of activities&lt;/p&gt;
